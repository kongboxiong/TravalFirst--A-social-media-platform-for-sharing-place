# TravalFirst: A social media platform for sharing place
 
This is a MERN stack interactive web application where users can share places with others.
A responsive layout and UI was implemented with React.js, CSS and Bootstrap. I created custom React Hooks and designed reusable JavaScript interfaces to reduce 8% lines of code after refactoring.
The back-end service was built with Node.js and Express framework to provide REST API endpoints. I deployed MongoDB on AWS EC2 for permanent storage. 
I utilized Google Maps JavaScript API to show the location of a place on a map.
The application was deployed on AWS EC2. Nginx was configured as a reverse proxy to serve the Node.js API and React front end.
